This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, subtlety in C programming related to the post-increment operator. The `bug.c` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior due to improper understanding of how the post-increment operator interacts with the `printf` function and expression evaluation.  The solution (`bugSolution.c`) provides the corrected code with explanation. This is a great example to study operator precedence and side effects in C.
